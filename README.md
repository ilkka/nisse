# Nisse

![Build and push](https://github.com/ilkka/nisse/workflows/Build%20and%20push/badge.svg)

Nisse is a home ERP system. I think I'm gonna start with plants, since that's what I need to solve right now.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
